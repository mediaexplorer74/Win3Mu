# Win3Mu 0.3.0-alpha
C# Windows 3.x emulator

RnD only. Not for any end user.

## About
forked/imported from https://bitbucket.org/toptensoftware/win3mu

The author: Brad Robinson (an independent software developer)

My idea is old as our brave world: UWP port of Win3Mu; Win 3 app "native" emulation for old poor PC, etc. :) 

Now for now, Win3Mu just "usual" .NET 4.8 app, not UWP app

## Progress (status)
RnD phase +-

Design phase +-

Tech phase +-

Dev phase +- (the code base rapidly converted into UWP / Xamarin Forms + downshifted to .NET 1.4)

## How-to to improve this RnD project

- Clone the src code

- Use VS 2022 to RnD it

- Learn the differences .NET 4.8 and .NET Standard 1.4

- Downgrade the code to 1.4...

- Debug, fix bugs, etc. 

- Get your UWP benefits

See "Repackage with Win3mu" video if you don't undestand this cool feature :)

- if you want to manually run ski.exe then simply type/enter the command:
win3mu ski.exe

AS IS. Win3Mu is RnD only, not for "gaming".
