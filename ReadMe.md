# Win3Mu
C# Windows 3.x emulator

RnD only. Not for any end user.

## About
forked/imported from https://bitbucket.org/toptensoftware/win3mu

The author: Brad Robinson (an independent software developer)

My idea is old as our brave world: UWP port of Win3Mu; Win 3 app "native" emulation for old poor PC, etc. :) 

Now for now, Win3Mu just "usual" .NET 4.8 app, not UWP app

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBpEU0PXbYM


## How-to

- Create some work folder, i.e. c:\win3mu

- unpack win3mu.zip and ski.zip to c:\win3mu

- if you want register "Convert to Win3Mu" command (at desktop popup/hot menu), just
run cmd.exe as Administator, change dir to c:\win3mu 
and type/enter the command:

win3mutool /register  

See "Repackage with Win3mu" video if you don't undestand this cool feature :)

- if you want manually run ski.exe then simply type/enter the command:
